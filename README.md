# DynamiCal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tedklin/dynamical.svg?token=EQ1yVHxTi52hGw7TPsW5&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tedklin/dynamical)

*This project is still very much a WIP.*

*DynamiCal* was born out of a desire to solidify concepts taught in an introductory class on systems ([EECS16B @Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp20/)), with a focus on the controls aspect of the course. It's evolved a little beyond the scope of 16B, as I started using the Astrom and Murray *Feedback Systems* text to self-study. I also plan to add concepts from other relevant classes I take.

*DynamiCal* aims to be both educational and applicable, with an intuitive interface and performance-driven design. Specific examples and formal documentation have not been created yet, but the [tests](https://github.com/tedklin/dynamical/tree/master/tests) might give a basic idea of general usage.
