# DynamiCal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tedklin/dynamical.svg?token=EQ1yVHxTi52hGw7TPsW5&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tedklin/dynamical)

*This project is still very much a WIP.*

*DynamiCal* was born out of a desire to solidify concepts learned in an introductory class on systems ([EECS16B @Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp20/)), with a focus on the controls aspect of the course. I plan to extend it to include concepts from other classes in this domain as well when I take them. *DynamiCal* aims to be both educational and applicable, with an intuitive interface and performance-driven design.
